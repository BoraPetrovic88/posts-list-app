## Preparing your development environment

### Prerequisites:

- Node 14+
- Yarn 1.22+

### Install Yarn (instead of NPM)

It's important to note that we are using yarn instead of npm. It's important to use yarn and only yarn (no `npm install`)

### VSCode configuration

Make sure you have installed plugins below with the following settings:

#### Prettier - Code formatter

This plugin is conflicting with Beautify plugin -> so please uninstall Beautify

Add the following preferences to the VSCode settings:

```js static
 "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
 "editor.formatOnSave": true,
 "prettier.requireConfig": true,
```

#### ESLint and Static Typechecking

ESLint is configured for static code analysis in the project.

Add the following preferences to the VSCode settings:

```js static
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "typescript",
    "typescriptreact"
  ],
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn check-types`

Runs static code type checking so we make sure typescript is happy

### `yarn lint`

Validates if everything is according to lint rules and automatically fixes issues when it is possible

### `yarn validate-and-build`

Runs linting, types checking and project build

# ⚙️ Project Configuration

The application has been bootstrapped using `Create React App` for simplicity reasons. It allows us to create applications quickly without dealing with a complex tooling setup such as bundling, transpiling etc.

You should always configure and use the following tools:

#### ESLint

ESLint is a linting tool for JavaScript. By providing specific configuration defined in the`.eslintrc.js` file it prevents developers from making silly mistakes in their code and enforces consistency in the codebase.

[ESLint Configuration Example Code](../.eslintrc.js)

#### Prettier

This is a great tool for formatting code. It enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase. By utilizing the "format on save" feature in your IDE you can automatically format the code based on the configuration provided in the `.prettierrc` file. It will also give you good feedback when something is wrong with the code. If the auto-format doesn't work, something is wrong with the code.

[Prettier Configuration Example Code](../.prettierrc)

#### TypeScript

ESLint is great for catching some of the bugs related to the language, but since JavaScript is a dynamic language ESLint cannot check data that run through the applications, which can lead to bugs, especially on larger projects. That is why TypeScript should be used. It is very useful during large refactors because it reports any issues you might miss otherwise. When refactoring, change the type declaration first, then fix all the TypeScript errors throughout the project and you are done. One thing you should keep in mind is that TypeScript does not protect your application from failing during runtime, it only does type checking during build time, but it increases development confidence drastically anyways. Here is a [great resource on using TypeScript with React](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/).

#### Husky

Husky is a tool for executing git hooks. Use Husky to run your code validations before every commit, thus making sure the code is in the best shape possible at any point of time and no faulty commits get into the repo. It can run linting, code formatting and type checking, etc. before it allows pushing the code. You can check how to configure it [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=usage).

### ⚙️ Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all of the application providers
|
+-- routes            # routes configuration
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- test              # test utilities and mock server
|
+-- types             # base types used accross the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the `features` folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every `feature` folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.

A feature could have the following structure:

```
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- routes      # route components for a specific feature pages
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for ta specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature
```

A feature folder could also contain other features (if used only within the parent feature) or be kept separated, it's a matter of preference.

Everything from a feature should be exported from the `index.ts` file which behaves as the public API of the feature.

You should import stuff from other features only by using:

`import {AwesomeComponent} from "../features/awesome-feature" `js

and not

`import {AwesomeComponent} from "../features/awesome-feature/components/AwesomeComponent`

# 🧱 Components And Styling

## Components Best Practices

#### Colocate things as close as possible to where it's being used

Keep components, functions, styles, state, etc. as close as possible to the component where it's being used. This will not only make your codebase more readable and easier to understand but it will also improve your application performance since it will reduce redundant re-renders on state updates.

#### Avoid large components with nested rendering functions

Do not add multiple rendering functions inside your application, this gets out of control pretty quickly. What you should do instead is if there is a piece of UI that can be considered as a unit, is to extract it in a separate component.

```javascript
// this is very difficult to maintain as soon as the component starts growing
function Component() {
  function renderItems() {
    return <ul>...</ul>;
  }
  return <div>{renderItems()}</div>;
}

// extract it in a separate component
function Items() {
  return <ul>...</ul>;
}

function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Items />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Stay consistent

Keep your code style consistent. e.g If you name your components by using pascal case, do it everywhere.

#### Limit the number of props a component is accepting as input

If your component is accepting too many props you might consider splitting it into multiple components or use the composition technique via children or slots.

# 👁️ Style Guide

When you work with large projects, it's important that you remain consistent throughout the codebase and follow the best practices. To guarantee the quality of your codebase, you need to analyze different levels of the applications code.

## Clean Code

This is the most abstract level of code standardization. It's related to the implementations independent of the programming language. It will help the readability of your code.

### Naming

One of the most important points of the Clean Code is how you name your functions, variables, components, etc. Use this amazing guide to understand how to write better variable names.
